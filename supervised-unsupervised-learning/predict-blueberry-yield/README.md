## Description
Blueberries are nutrient-rich, perennial shrubs known for their vibrant blue or purple berries. Native to North America, they come in two main types: lowbush (wild) and highbush (cultivated). Lowbush blueberries grow closer to the ground and produce smaller, intensely flavored berries, while highbush varieties are taller and yield larger fruit. Canada dominates lowbush blueberry production, while the U.S. leads in highbush cultivation.

## Goals
Build a regression model to predict the yield of wild blueberries based on various agronomic and environmental factors.

## Data Dictionary
This project utilizes a dataset sourced from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pascmlsig/data).

> 🔧🚧 **Heads-up: This Code Is a Work in Progress**
>
> I'm continuously improving and refining the code as time allows, but there’s no fixed schedule for updates or new features.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.8 or higher and Jupyter Notebook.

All required Python packages and their exact versions are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) file.

To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Getting Started
To run this project locally and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saurabh-kudesia/real-world-ai-projects.git
cd real-world-ai-projects/structured-eda/uncovering-trends-in-netflix-content/
````

### 2. Set Up the Environment
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies.

* **Using `pip`:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install core libraries if `requirements.txt` is not present:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### 3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook
> ⚠️ Make sure you have Python installed, along with Jupyter Notebook.
> Specific package versions are listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt).

```bash
jupyter notebook source/uncovering-trends-in-netflix-content-sk.ipynb
```
