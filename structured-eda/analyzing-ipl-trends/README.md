## Description
The [Indian Premier League (IPL)](https://www.iplt20.com/) is a premier professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, established in 2008. It showcases teams from various cities and regions, typically running annually from March to May. Renowned for its thrilling matches and featuring star players from around the globe, the IPL has become one of the most lucrative cricket leagues in the world, attracting substantial financial investments.

## Goals
This project aims to analyze IPL data from 2008 to 2019, focusing on key metrics to uncover actionable insights and trends. The goal is to enhance our understanding of the league's dynamics and provide valuable information about it.

## Data Dictionary
This project utilizes a dataset sourced from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhkudesia/ipl-trends-2008-2019/data). It contains detailed metadata about Netflix's content.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.8 or higher and Jupyter Notebook.

All required Python packages and their exact versions are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) file.

To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
