# Machine Learning in Action: Real-World AI Projects
Welcome to my public repository — perfect for learners, practitioners, and contributors interested in exploring and applying real-world machine learning and AI techniques. These projects reflect a journey of experimentation, learning, and hands-on implementation across various domains of artificial intelligence.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is an ongoing project and is continuously evolving. New AI and ML projects will be added regularly — stay tuned for updates!

## What's Inside?
This repository features practical and research-driven projects in:
- **Structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - [Uncovering Trends in Netflix Content](structured-eda/uncovering-trends-in-netflix-content/)
   - [Analyzing IPL Trends: Insights from 2008 to 2019](/structured-eda/analyzing-ipl-trends/)

- **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**
   - [Handwritten Character Recognition with EMNIST](deep-learning-nn/handwritten-character-recognition/)

- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Time Series Forecasting
- MLOps and Model Deployment

Each project will be self-contained with code, documentation, and instructions.

## Articles & Writing
In addition to this code repository, I actively write about data science, machine learning, and practical project workflows on platforms like Medium and Kaggle. See the full list [here](ARTICLES.md). These pieces complement the projects here with deeper context, theory, and lessons learned.

```

## How to Use
To run any project:
1. Navigate to the relevant folder under `project-category/`.
2. Review the `README.md` in that folder for instructions.
3. Set up your environment using the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Run the notebooks or Python scripts inside the `source/` directory.

Projects use a variety of standard Python libraries including:

- `pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn` for data science
- `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` for deep learning
- `spaCy`, `NLTK` for NLP
- `OpenCV` for computer vision
- Tools like `Flask`, `FastAPI`, or `Streamlit` for deployment (coming soon)

## Roadmap
Here's what to expect in future updates:
- Baseline ML models with clean code
- Model training & evaluation pipelines
- Model deployment examples (APIs, dashboards, etc.)
- Experiment tracking and logging tools
- Mini case studies and data stories

Stay tuned and star ⭐ this repo if you'd like to follow along!
